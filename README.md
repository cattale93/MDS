# MDS

In this project there are 2 main subjects:

1) Image watermarking performed by means of "Embedding_dwt_dct_8x8_arnold_UFF.m". It is an algorithm which takes an image as input and 
output the same image marked. The mark does not degreade the image and is retrivable even if some attacker would try to clear it.

2) Image tampering detection performed using the "get_map_.m" in this file are implemented different detection techniques which are
applied to an input image and output a map of the possible tampered areas.
